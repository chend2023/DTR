# Scaling properties of scale-free networks in degree-thresholding renormalization flows 

Author: Dan Chen, Defu Cai, and Housheng Su

We present the python sample code, and the computer configuration is Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400@2.60GHZ.  Before using this sample code, make sure you have the following packages installed on your computer:

```python
Python3
numpy==1.23.2
networkx==2.8.6
notebook==6.5.2
matplotlib==3.5.3
scipy==1.9.3
SciencePlots==1.0.9
Latex
```

Here, we present only part of the sample code and show the results under a single implementation. In our paper, we present the statistical average results of multiple independent samples.
